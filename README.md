- 👋 Hi, I’m Maria Gerendiain, a Fullstack developer.
  
- ⚡ After 3 years of working as a kindergarten teacher, I decided to leave that career behind once I discovered the world of development since I felt I was completely stuck in life. I realized I wanted to grow, that I craved to learn and keep learning new things, and here's where I began to feel somewhat different.
  
- 👀 I’m interested in contributing to significant projects and in growing as a programmer
- 🌱 I’m currently learning PHP and MySQL, and I intend to learn Python and Java in the future.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate anywhere I can learn opportunities!
  
- 📫 Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-gerendiain-soler-b326a92a6/
